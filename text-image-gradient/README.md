# Gradient Text Animation

This project demonstrates an animated gradient effect applied to text using pure HTML and CSS. The effect leverages `background-clip: text` and a CSS animation to create a moving gradient across large, uppercase heading text.

## Features

- Large, uppercase heading (`<h1>`)
- Animated gradient background clipped to text
- Smooth infinite horizontal animation

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the basic HTML structure and heading element.
- `main.css`: Includes the CSS for styling and animating the text.
- `gradient.webp`: The gradient image used for the background.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the project** to your local machine.
2. **Ensure the `gradient.webp` file** is placed in the same directory as `main.css`.
3. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser to view the animation.

## Example Output

The heading "Hi Team" will appear in large letters with a colorful gradient smoothly moving across the text.

## Customization

- Change the `font-size` in `main.css` to resize the heading.
- Replace `gradient.webp` with any other image to use a different gradient or texture.
- Adjust the animation duration (`10s`) or background movement (`-500px`) for different effects.
